Version History:

2.0.9   Feature Update
            1.) Added a function to the admin page to poll GitHub for the current release version, and notify
                the botmaster if a new version is available, providing a link to the latest version.

2.0.8   Performed the following upgrades/fixes:
            1.) Added version information to the admin page. so that botmasters can see at a glance which version
                they're using. This is a prelude to a new "version check" feature that I'm working on.
            2.) Corrected a bug where changing the bot's default page format wasn't being reflected in the config
                file. PLEASE NOTE that if you have several chatbots, this will affect ALL of them, but if that's
                the case, you shouldn't be relying on the default chatbot page anyway.

2.0.7   Two major changes, this time:
            1.) Removed some settings from the install script that had been causing new chatbots to
              fail to respond. These settings are still available in the admin pages, but during installation
              are given default values.
            2.) Added support for uploading ZIP file archives of AIML files, to make the process of adding
              AIML files less faster and less tedious. the size limit for uploading files is still 2MB,
              but a 2MB ZIP file can hold a LOT of AIML files. 

2.0.6   Performed the following upgrades/fixes:
            1.) Corrected typographical errors in several files, both in the admin pages, and in the config files.
            2.) Consolidated error logging, adding a /logs/ folder to the base directory. Error logs are
              also named for the pages where the errors occur. (e.g. admin-error.log for the admin pages,
              install-error.log, etc.)
            3.) Updated the addon checkForBan, activating it, and adding functionality to add banned users
              to the list of banned IP addresses. It's still up to the botmaster to implement banning in
              their AIML files. To ban a user, insert the following into the apropriate AIML template:
              <ban><get name="ip_address" /></ban>
          For further assistance, please check out the Program O Support Forums.

2.0.5   Fixed a bug where uploaded AIML files were not being added to the DB, even if they passed validation.
        Also added the variable $default_charset to allow character encoding other than UTF-8 for both AIML
        files and chatbot pages. Further, experimental support for international characters has been added.
        This is far from it's "final" implementation, but we hope that it's a start.

2.0.4   Fixed a bug in the debugging functions that caused empty debugging files to be created on non-Windows systems

2.0.3   Added simple AIML validation to the upload script, and restyled the admin pages accordingly

2.0.2   Unspecified Bug fixes

2.0.1   Unspecified Bug fixes

2.0.0   Initial Release
