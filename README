Introduction

Program O is an AIML interpretor written in PHP
The bot engine sits in the /chatbot/ directory
The admin area can be found in the /admin/ directory
Functions used by the bot and the admin area are in the /library/ directory
Any optional addons are found in the /chatbot/addons/ directory

Configuration
---------------------------------------------------------
v2.0.1 has support for multiple bots
Configuration of the individual bots is done from inside the admin area.
Bot specific variables are stored in the database.
Configuration of Program O itself is done in /config/global_config.php

Using the bot
---------------------------------------------------------
After installation you can chat to Program O in one of 3 ways
-HTML form (example in /gui/plain/index.php)
-HTML form using AJAX (example in /gui/jquery/index.php)
-send XML using CURL (return response in XML or JSON) (example in /gui/xml/index.php)

Upgrade
---------------------------------------------------------
If you are upgrading from v1 you will need to make the following changes to the db
Back up your old files then overwrite with the new ones

Clean install
---------------------------------------------------------
v2.0.1 has an automatic installer for clean installation.
Simply point your web browser to your freshly uploaded
Program O directory to run the install script. Then
follow the instructions on the page. The installer is
designed to only run once.

Please note that the installer script will NOT  create your
database for you, nor will it install your bot's AIML files.
The database, along with the username/password used to
access it, needs to be created in advance. See the file
fresh_install_README.txt for more information.

After you create the database, and once you complete the
installation process, simply go to your new Program O
admin page (e.g. http://www.example.com/ProgramO/admin)
and log in using the admin credentials you provided during
the install process. Then select "Upload AIML" from the
navigation link on the left and upload your AIML files.
Then sit back and enjoy your new bot!
